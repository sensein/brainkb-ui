## BrainKB UI Code of Conduct

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 11, 2024

### Our Commitment

At BrainKB UI, we value the participation of every contributor. We aim to foster a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment where people of all backgrounds and identities can collaborate, learn, and grow. We are committed to providing an open and friendly space—free of harassment, discrimination, and other forms of intimidation—so that our community can focus on what matters: building great software and knowledge tools together.

### Who This Code Applies To

This Code of Conduct (CoC) applies to all contributors, maintainers, and community members involved in this project’s activities. It covers:

- Participation in public project forums, such as issue trackers, pull requests, and discussion boards.
- Communication through community channels, including GitHub comments, Slack or Discord discussions, mailing lists, and other project-related mediums.
- In-person interactions at events, meetups, or conferences representing the project.

### Expected Behavior

**In all project spaces, we expect community members to:**

1. **Be Respectful and Kind:**  
   Treat everyone you interact with as a valued collaborator. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Be patient and supportive of others, especially newcomers.

2. **Be Open to Different Perspectives:**  
   Approach discussions with an open mind. Understand that others may have viewpoints, backgrounds, and experiences different from your own. Constructively share opinions while acknowledging and learning from feedback.

3. **Maintain a Collaborative Spirit:**  
   Engage in dialogue that helps move the project forward. Offer help and support when possible, and celebrate the contributions of others. Give credit where it’s due, and strive to address conflicts in a spirit of cooperation.

4. **Respect Personal Boundaries and Privacy:**  
   Refrain from sharing personal information about others without their consent. Show respect for each individual’s comfort levels and personal boundaries.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in any project space, and will not be tolerated:

1. **Harassment, Hate, and Discrimination:**  
   Slurs, insults, or demeaning comments based on race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other personal characteristics.

2. **Threats, Intimidation, and Incitement of Violence:**  
   Direct or indirect threats, bullying, or calls for violence, as well as encouraging others to engage in these behaviors.

3. **Personal Attacks and Demeaning Language:**  
   Sustained personal insults, name-calling, ad hominem attacks, or rudeness intended to degrade or belittle others.

4. **Disruptive Behavior and Excessive Criticism:**  
   Non-constructive criticism intended solely to disrupt or tear down other people’s work; persistent interruptions of discussions; repeated unwelcome comments that interfere with others’ ability to contribute.

5. **Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Imagery:**  
   Sexualized language, imagery, or advances; sharing of sexually explicit or violent material; unwelcome or inappropriate touching or physical contact if meeting in person.

### Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have any concerns, please take one or more of the following steps:

- **Private Report:** Contact the project maintainers at [tekraj@mit.edu](tekraj@mit.edu) to report the issue. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially.
- **Public Request for Moderation:** If a situation occurs in a public forum (e.g., a GitHub issue, pull request, or discussion), you may respectfully request that moderators intervene.

**The project maintainers will:**

- Review all reported incidents.
- Keep reports confidential to the greatest extent possible.
- Take actions deemed appropriate to the situation, which may include warnings, temporary communication bans, permanent bans, or other measures to maintain a safe and respectful environment.
